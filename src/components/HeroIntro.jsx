            Armed with the real world experience I was recently a UX Designer for GitHub. I specialize in implementing System Thinking, within an Agile
            environment for B2B products. Including: SaaS, Ecommerce, and Support Portals. 
            And if clients are low on developers I help them code as well. On a lighter note, in my spare time I experiment in developing for VR/MR, but my passions are in UX/UI.
